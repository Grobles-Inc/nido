# Content Management Guide

This project uses Astro's Content Collections for managing content. Content is primarily written in MDX format and organized in the `src/content/` directory.

## Content Structure

- Content is organized into collections defined in [src/content.config.ts](mdc:src/content.config.ts)
- Each collection has its own directory in `src/content/`
- Content files use the `.mdx` extension
- Frontmatter is used for metadata and configuration

## Content Types

1. **Blog Posts** (`src/content/blog/`)
   - Blog articles and posts
   - Include frontmatter for title, date, author, etc.
   - Can use MDX for rich content

2. **Pages** (`src/content/pages/`)
   - Static content pages
   - Can be used for about, contact, or other static content
   - Supports MDX for rich formatting

## Content Features

- **MDX Support**: Write content using MDX for enhanced markdown
- **Type Safety**: Content schemas are defined in `content.config.ts`
- **RSS Feed**: Blog posts are automatically included in the RSS feed
- **Sitemap**: Content is automatically included in the sitemap

## Best Practices

- Use consistent frontmatter across content types
- Keep content files focused and well-organized
- Use MDX components for interactive elements
- Follow the defined content schema
- Use relative links for internal content references

## Example Content Structure

```
src/content/
├── blog/
│   ├── post-1.mdx
│   └── post-2.mdx
├── pages/
│   ├── about.mdx
│   └── contact.mdx
└── config.ts        # Collection configuration
```

## Content Frontmatter Example
